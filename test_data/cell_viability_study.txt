Cell Viability Assay Results - Drug A Treatment Study
======================================================

Experiment Date: February 2026
Cell Line: HeLa (Human cervical cancer)
Treatment: Novel kinase inhibitor (Drug A)

METHODOLOGY
-----------
Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to 
adhere overnight. Drug A was administered at concentrations ranging from 
0.1 µM to 100 µM. Cell viability was assessed using MTT assay after 48 hours.

RESULTS
-------
| Concentration (µM) | Cell Viability (%) | Std Dev |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 0 (Control)        | 100.0             | 3.2     |
| 0.1                | 98.7              | 4.1     |
| 1.0                | 92.3              | 5.6     |
| 5.0                | 78.4              | 6.2     |
| 10.0               | 54.2              | 7.8     |
| 25.0               | 32.1              | 5.4     |
| 50.0               | 18.7              | 4.2     |
| 100.0              | 8.3               | 2.9     |

IC50 CALCULATION
----------------
The calculated IC50 value for Drug A is approximately 12.4 µM in HeLa cells.

OBSERVATIONS
------------
1. Drug A shows dose-dependent cytotoxicity
2. Significant cell death observed at concentrations > 10 µM
3. Morphological changes (cell rounding, detachment) visible at 25 µM and above
4. No significant toxicity at sub-micromolar concentrations

NEXT STEPS
----------
- Repeat experiment with MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell line
- Perform apoptosis assay to confirm mechanism of cell death
- Analyze expression of pro-apoptotic genes (TP53, BAX, PUMA)
